## 🚀 Highlight Project

### [CodeLearnEngine](https://github.com/XTunahan/CodeLearnEngine)

**CodeLearnEngine** is a Qt/QML desktop application written in C++ that acts as an interactive coding trainer powered by multiple LLM providers.

It implements a modular architecture separating:

- UI layer (Qt/QML)
- Domain logic
- Infrastructure adapters for LLM providers

### Key Engineering Aspects

- Multi-provider LLM integration (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Gemini, Ollama)
- Provider abstraction layer
- Structured task generation & solution evaluation workflows
- Local token usage tracking and cost estimation
- Clear separation between UI and business logic
- Extensible design for additional providers and features

The project focuses on engineering quality, not just feature delivery.

## 📈 Engineering Philosophy

I approach software development as system design — not just code writing.

Each project is built to:
- Improve architectural clarity
- Reduce hidden complexity
- Strengthen abstraction boundaries
- Keep long-term maintainability in mind
